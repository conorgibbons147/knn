        "1) Classification is when we are looking to sort objects into a certain number of groups based on shared attributes of the group. Each data point is assigned to a category. Regression involves predicting based on a continuous model which is built on the input of variables from known data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) This is a crosstabulation of the predicted and actual values of a regression which allows us to check the accuracy of our predictive model.\n",

        "\n",
        "5) Splitting the data allows you to train the model with a large amount of data while still having a sufficient sample to ensure the model is accurate. You can use the test data which acts as new data to choose K based on the SSE. Finding the optimal K value will allow your model to be as accurate as possible on new data.\n",

        "6) With the class label as a prediction approach, it is very good for times when there are few categories that are very clearly defined. It doesn't, however, give us any understanding of the uncertainty. Using a probability distribution over class labels allows us to recognize uncertainty but it is much more complex than the other approach."
